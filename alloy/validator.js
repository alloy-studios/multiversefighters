/**
 * UMBRA - Alloy Accounts validator.
 * The game is index.html in alloy-studios/multiversefighters; its save code is
 * the SPECIAL FIGHTERS section (search "ACCOUNT SYNC").
 *
 * What UMBRA keeps between visits (localStorage "umbra.*", synced as one save):
 *   stats     { wins, best, ults, matches }
 *   cleared   [ path ids ]    paths the player has finished
 *   kept      [ fighter ids ] limited guests kept for good by clearing their
 *                             path while their event was on
 *   unlocked  [ fighter ids ] unlockable fighters earned by playing
 *
 * CLAMP, DON'T REJECT. Nothing here throws. Garbage becomes the default, a
 * number that is too big or arrived too fast is clamped, an id the game does
 * not have is dropped. A rejected save never replaces the stored one, so any
 * Reject an honest save could reach would lock the player out for good.
 *
 * Nothing the server has accepted is ever taken away: counts never go down and
 * the three lists are the union of the stored save and the new one.

/*
 * RATES - derived from index.html, not from feel.
 *
 * wins: endMatch() adds 1 when the player wins a match against the CPU
 *   (versus CPU, or a fight on a path). A match is first to two rounds:
 *   startMatch() zeroes both fighters' round wins, and endMatch() runs only
 *   once one of them has 2. Every round opens with beginRoundCall(), which
 *   holds "ROUND n" for later(1.25) before FIGHT. Every KO waits later(2.1)
 *   and then later(1.4) before the next round or endMatch() - 3.5 s. A round
 *   that goes to time instead runs its 99 s timer. So a won match is at least
 *       2 rounds x (1.25 s + 3.5 s) = 9.5 s
 *   and the fight itself only adds to that. later() runs on game time, which
 *   advances by each frame's real delta times GAME.slow (never above 1), and
 *   frame() caps a frame at 50 ms, so game time never runs ahead of real time.
 *       => 1 win per 9.5 s, burst 1.
 *
 * ults: startUlt() adds 1 when the player's ultimate connects (any mode but
 *   training). Ultimate cutscenes cannot be skipped (only win screens and path
 *   scenes take a skip), nothing else can start until one ends, and every
 *   ultimate opens with the 0.62 s super flash. The shortest cutscene, measured
 *   in real time from the game's own shot lists and speed ramps, is Morrow's
 *   Hollow Grasp at 5.45 s (the rest run 5.9 to 14.8 s). So two ultimates are
 *   at least 5.45 + 0.62 = 6.07 s apart.
 *       => 1 ultimate per 6 s, burst 1.
 *
 * matches: part of the stats shape, but nothing counts it yet. Kept as a
 *   lifetime count at the win rate, since a match lasts at least as long as a
 *   won one.
 *
 * best: the hardest CPU difficulty beaten, -1 (none) to 3 (the game has four
 *   levels, AIL). It changes only on a win and can go straight to 3 with one,
 *   so it has no rate: it is clamped to that range, needs at least one win, and
 *   never goes down.
 *
 * cleared: a path is cleared when its fourth fight is won (pathAfter()), and
 *   each of those fights is a won match that also counts in wins. So an honest
 *   save always has cleared.length <= floor(wins / 4), and the wins rate bounds
 *   how fast paths can be cleared.
 *
 * kept: the game keeps a limited guest only when their path is cleared while
 *   their event is live (keepNow in pathAfter()). The server checks the same
 *   thing on its own clock, never the player's. The game draws an event's
 *   window from 00:00 on `from` to 00:00 on `to` in the player's local time,
 *   and local midnight falls somewhere between UTC-14h and UTC+12h. So the
 *   server accepts a new kept guest only while its own time is inside
 *       [ from 00:00 UTC - 14 h,  to 00:00 UTC + 12 h )
 *   the widest window any honest player on Earth can see, and nothing outside
 *   it. The guest must also be in cleared. Once stored, a kept guest stays.
 *
 * unlocked: an unlockable fighter is earned by wins, ultimates, a difficulty
 *   beaten or a cleared path, and checkUnlocks() adds it the moment its need is
 *   met. The server re-checks the need against this save's own cleaned stats.
 *   There are no unlockable fighters yet, so UNLOCK is empty and every id is
 *   dropped. That costs nothing: the game still shows a fighter unlocked while
 *   its need is met. When the game adds one, add its need here.
 *
 * EVENTS: wins and ultimates have the honest ceilings above, but the game does
 *   not report either to Alloy events yet, so none are declared.
